Oh, hey!

So this is my read me. My first public one since all my others are private due to them having class material in them. 

This repository is purely for my trials and errors during my time learning C. It may evolve into something more beautiful, but that is for future me to decide. I probably will decide to make different repos for the prettier things. 

Hopefully we will see some cool things in C in this repo though! Without further ado, let my journeys in C begin!
